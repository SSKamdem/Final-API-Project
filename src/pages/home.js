            Hi there, and welcome to the website!

            I've picked a few recipes I found interesting from the food API to display. You can click on any of the names on the navigation bar at the top and you get to discover a recipe I bet you didn't know! So, to all the chefs out there who like to experiment with new recipes, here's your chance!
